<analysis>
The trajectory outlines the development of Ofertas do PIT, an offer-sharing platform, initially using a React, FastAPI, and MongoDB stack. The AI successfully built the MVP, implementing core features like offer listing, categories, a basic admin panel, and a functional dark/light theme toggle. Key decisions included using Shadcn UI for components and carefully managing environment variables and API routing. The admin login ( / ) and initial data seeding were handled.

The user then requested several enhancements, including making product cards clickable to a dedicated product page and correcting admin UI colors. These were also successfully implemented. A significant pivot occurred when the user requested a completely free, serverless deployment. The AI first proposed a Cloudflare Workers/Pages/D1 solution, detailing the migration. However, due to user-side setup difficulties with Cloudflare CLI and a preference for Netlify, the project is now being migrated to a Netlify Functions and Supabase (PostgreSQL) architecture, which the AI has just begun to implement, focusing on the backend functions and frontend structure.

<product_requirements>
The user requested a full-stack website named Ofertas do PIT, a platform for product promotions, inspired by .
Key features include:
1.  **Visual Identity**: Based on a provided logo, with a dark mode default ( background,  primary,  text), optional accent (), and specific fonts (Impact/Anton for titles, Arial/Roboto/Lato for body).
2.  **Theme Toggle**: A sun/moon icon in the header to switch between Dark (default) and Light themes ( background,  or  primary,  text).
3.  **Backend Data Structures**:
    *   : , , , ,  (auto-calculated), ,  (relation), , .
    *   : , .
    *   : ,  (hashed),  (). Initial admin:  / .
4.  **Frontend Structure**: Fixed header (logo, navigation, theme toggle) and footer (copyright).
    *   Navigation: Grupo de Ofertas (WhatsApp/Telegram links), Melhores Ofertas (main promotions list), Categorias (filterable list).
    *   Melhores Ofertas Page: Grid layout of offer cards (image, title, offer price, discount), sortable (latest, discount, price).
    *   **Enhancements**: Product cards should be clickable, leading to a new dedicated Produto page displaying full details and a link to the offer. Admin panel's product insertion form category names should have black text.
5.  **Admin Panel ()**: Restricted to  role, with functionalities to list, add, edit, and delete promotions via a form covering all  fields.
6.  **Deployment**: Initially requested to host on , then refactor to a 100% free serverless architecture using Cloudflare, and finally shifted to Netlify Functions + Supabase for the same free hosting objective.

<code_architecture>
The project architecture has evolved significantly.

**Initial Project Structure (FastAPI + React + MongoDB):**

-   : The main FastAPI application, initially configured with routes for promotions, categories, authentication, and CRUD operations. This file underwent initial setup, then modifications for the admin login email correction and API endpoints for product details.
-   : Python dependencies required for the FastAPI backend. Updated during initial setup to include , , , etc.
-   : The primary React component managing application routing (homepage, categories, groups, admin, individual product page), global layout (header, footer), and the theme toggle logic. This file was extensively modified for initial UI, navigation, product page integration, and the theme switch.
-    and : These files define the global and component-specific styling, incorporating the brand's color palette, typography, responsive design, and theme-specific variables for dark/light mode. They were updated for initial styling, admin UI color fixes, product page layout, and theme toggle visual states.
-    and : Environment variables, crucial for configuring API endpoints () and database connections ().

**Current Project Structure (Netlify Functions + React + Supabase):**
The project is currently being re-architected into a serverless structure. The AI has just begun creating this new directory.

-   : This will be the serverless backend, handling all API requests, integrating with Supabase, and managing JWT authentication. It implements all the CRUD operations and data retrieval previously handled by FastAPI.
-   : Contains helper functions such as CORS handling, UUID generation, password hashing, JWT generation/verification, discount calculation, and slug creation.
-   : Encapsulates all interactions with the Supabase PostgreSQL database, including schema setup, data retrieval, insertion, updates, and deletions for promotions, categories, users, and configurations.
-   : This configuration file is essential for Netlify deployment, specifying how the project is built, where Netlify Functions are located, the publish directory for the frontend, and crucial redirect rules to route  requests to the Netlify Functions. It also defines CORS headers.
-   : Manages all Node.js dependencies for both the React frontend and the Netlify Functions. It includes  to ensure function-specific packages like , , and  are available.
-   , , , , : These are the core files for the React frontend, currently being generated/adapted to consume the new Netlify Functions API while maintaining the established visual identity and functionalities.
</code_architecture>

<pending_tasks>
-   Complete the development and adaptation of the React frontend (, related components, styling) for the new Netlify Functions + Supabase backend.
-   Provide detailed instructions for the user to set up and configure the Supabase database (creating tables, inserting initial data) based on the provided SQL schema.
-   Guide the user through the final Netlify deployment steps, including connecting the GitHub repository, setting environment variables, and verifying the deployed application.
-   Thoroughly test the Netlify + Supabase application to ensure all functionalities and the visual design are preserved and working correctly.
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI was in the process of completely re-architecting the Ofertas do PIT application from its initial FastAPI + React + MongoDB stack to a new serverless architecture utilizing Netlify Functions and Supabase (PostgreSQL). This migration was initiated based on the user's explicit request for a 100% free hosting and database solution, after an earlier attempt to migrate to Cloudflare Workers/D1 encountered user-side setup issues.

The AI has successfully created the foundational directory structure for the new project under . This includes:
-   The root  for managing dependencies.
-   The  configuration file, which defines Netlify's build process, function paths, redirects, and CORS headers.
-   The core backend serverless logic within :
    -   : The main entry point for Netlify Functions, handling all API routes (health check, auth, categories, promotions, social links), integrating with Supabase, and managing JWT.
    -   : Provides shared utility functions like CORS handling, ID generation, password hashing, and JWT operations.
    -   : Contains the Supabase client and all database interaction logic for promotions, categories, users, and configurations.
-   Initial frontend files under  and :
    -   , , ,  for the React application.
    -    in .

The AI is currently creating the React frontend components and pages (, , ) to integrate with the newly defined Netlify Functions API. The previous API routes and visual identity from the original project are being adapted to this new serverless frontend-backend communication pattern. The user has been provided with the SQL schema to create the Supabase database and has acknowledged the shift to Netlify.

<optional_next_step>
Complete the development of the React frontend to fully integrate with the Netlify Functions API, maintaining all existing features and visual aesthetics.
